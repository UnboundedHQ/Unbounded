# canvrs

Hi — I’m canvrs, a developer based in Germany. I work at [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech), where we build tools that improve the way people use the web.

I enjoy working on clean, focused products — mostly browser extensions and web utilities — and I care about details, UX, and performance.

### What I’m Building

At modcore, I’ve contributed to projects like:

- [**modcore Extension Manager**](https://github.com/modcoretech/modcore-extension-manager)  
  A better way to manage your browser extensions.

- [**Link Sanitizer**](https://github.com/modcoretech/link-sanitizer)  
  Automatically removes trackers and clutter from URLs.

- [**Dictionary Extension**](https://github.com/modcoretech/dictionary-extension)  
  A lightweight in-page dictionary for quick reference.

And there’s more on the way — always experimenting, improving, and building things that feel good to use.

### Elsewhere

You can find most of my work through [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech).  
Occasionally, I write or share things — but most of the time, I'm building quietly.
