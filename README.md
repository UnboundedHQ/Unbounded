# canvrs

i’m canvrs, a developer from germany who builds web tools that try to stay out of the way but make a real difference. i spend most of my time at [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech), where the focus is on extensions and utilities that make the web smoother, faster, and a little saner.

## what i’m working on

- [**modcore extension manager**](https://github.com/modcoretech/modcore-extension-manager)  
  manage, analyze, and customize your browser extensions without the clutter.  

- [**link sanitizer**](https://github.com/modcoretech/link-sanitizer)  
  strip trackers and noise from urls before they follow you around.  

- [**dictionary extension**](https://github.com/modcoretech/dictionary-extension)  
  a fast, lightweight dictionary that works right where you are.  

new tools and ideas are always in the mix — i like experimenting with small things that can scale.

## about me

- germany-based, fluent in english & german, learning spanish and turkish  
- into web development, design systems, and games
- focused on details, ux, and performance — because the small stuff adds up

## elsewhere

most of what i build lives at [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech).  
sometimes i write or share thoughts, but mostly, i’m shipping and refining quietly.
